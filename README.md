# weather-service-wsdl

This __WSDL__ was build to serve as a good example for enterprisey WebService-Interfaces, like the [BiPro-Services](https://www.bipro.net/) and accompanying the blog-post services around [https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2016/02/spring-boot-apache-cxf/](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2016/02/spring-boot-apache-cxf/).

It contains just the WeatherServiceÂ´s WSDL and all imported XSD-Files. The WSDL was originally inspired by the WeatherService from [http://www.webservicex.com/new/Home/Index](http://www.webservicex.com/new/Home/Index).
